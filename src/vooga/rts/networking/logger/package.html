This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
<h1>Description</h1>
This package is the logger package. It contains a NetworkLogger that 
serves as a wrapper for a Java.util.Logger instance. It also contains
IHandlerFormat that serves as a way to get various Handlers to the 
NetworkLogger.
</p>

<p>
<h2> Specifics </h2>
Network Logger is a class that handles a logger. It makes use of the singleton pattern
to guarantee the use of a single logger in the program
This class does not propagate LogRecords to parent Loggers, so if the
user wants the log printed on the console, he should manually call addHandler
with FORMAT_CONSOLE as input
By default, the logger starts at ALL level so any type of message is logged 
Note that the user does not need to use any other class in this package 
except this one to manage the logger
