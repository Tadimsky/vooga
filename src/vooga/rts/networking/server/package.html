This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains all the exclusively server-side code. 

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p>
MatchmakerServer, GameContainer, Room, Lobby, and GameServer all subclass
from AbstractThreadContainer. This was intended to abstract out common
functionality among classes. 

<p>
A MatchmakerServer contains multiple GameContainers. A GameContainer contains
multiple Rooms, which can be Lobbies or GameServers. All of these contain
ConnectionThreads.

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p>
The ConnectionServer listens for connections on the port. Once is receives
one, it starts a new ConectionThread and passes that to the MatchmakerServer. 
The client must then send an InitialConnectionMessage as its first 
message. If this is received the ConnectionThread is moved to a 
GameContainer corresponding to its game name. The client can then send
requests to the GameContainer which it will send back with information. The
client can ask to join a Room, which will, in this case, be a Lobby. Once in the
Lobby, the client can change settings until the game is ready to launch,
at which point the GameServer is instantiated and starts passing GameMessages back and
forth.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
More levels could be added by extending AbstractThreadContainer. The easiest way to 
extend for a game designer (non-RTS game) would be to extend GameContainer. They could then
use their own behavior or their own Lobby and GameServer classes to create different behavior
for their game. The way they would let the server know about this different class would
be to add to the configuration.properties file in the resources package
 a key of their game name to a value of the name of the class that 
extends GameContainer.
