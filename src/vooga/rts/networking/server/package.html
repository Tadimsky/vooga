This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains all the exclusively server-side code. 

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p>
MatchmakerServer, GameContainer, Room, Lobby, and GameServer all subclass
from AbstractThreadContainer. This was intended to abstract out common
functionality among classes. 

<p>
A MatchmakerServer contains multiple GameContainers. A GameContainer contains
multiple Rooms, which can be Lobbies or GameServers. All of these contain
ConnectionThreads.

<h4> Client workflow in the server </h4>
<p>
The ConnectionServer listens for connections on the port. Once is receives
one, it starts a new ConectionThread and passes that to the MatchmakerServer. 
The client must then send an InitialConnectionMessage as its first 
message. If this is received the ConnectionThread is moved to a 
GameContainer corresponding to its game name. The client can then send
requests to the GameContainer which it will send back with information. The
client can ask to join a Room, which will, in this case, be a Lobby. Once in the
Lobby, the client can change settings until the game is ready to launch,
at which point the GameServer is instantiated and starts passing GameMessages back and
forth.
